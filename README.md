# Countdown To The End of High Seas ‚¨áÔ∏è

This is a site which is a countdown to the end of High Seas (January 31st). It can be accessed here: https://pay-pies.neetocode.com/site/qingrui-xie/01JGPEA1E1GD9DBCMQPCR6J0AB and has been hosted on neetocode.
I used Vanilla HTML with CSS & Javascript within the style & script elements, edited in Microsoft VS Code (Visual Studio Code).

## How to Use:
- Just watch it go down I guess
- To remind you how much time you have got left

## Credits:
- Most of the countdown javascript code: w3schools
- The rest of the code: me
- Background: i edited this image https://highseas.hackclub.com/background.svg using pixlr.e (https://pixlr.com/editor/)
- Little watermark thing: i used this font https://www.fontspace.com/casual-tossed-font-f81 from fontspace for the text and edited this image https://i.pinimg.com/736x/43/ed/66/43ed6691c8fe72d724156ee3949f69c6.jpg with it

(I finally sort of learned how to use markdown ü•≥)
