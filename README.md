# Countdown To The End of High Seas ⬇️

This is a site which is a countdown to the end of High Seas (January 31st). It can be accessed here: https://pay-pies.neetocode.com/site/qingrui-xie/01JGPEA1E1GD9DBCMQPCR6J0AB and has been hosted on neetocode.
I used Vanilla HTML with CSS & Javascript within the style & script elements, edited in Microsoft VS Code (Visual Studio Code).

## Credits:
- most of the countdown javascript code: w3schools
- the rest of the code: me
